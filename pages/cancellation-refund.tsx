                        </Typography>
                        - **For Clients**: You may cancel a project before the freelancer starts working. If the freelancer has already started, cancellations will only be allowed with the freelancerâ€™s consent.
                        - **For Freelancers**: Freelancers are encouraged to notify the client promptly if they need to cancel a project before starting work. Failure to complete the work after starting may result in a negative rating.
                        
                        <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
                            2. Refund Policy
                        </Typography>
                        - **For Clients**: Refunds can be requested if the service delivered does not meet the agreed-upon scope. Requests must be made within **7 days** of receiving the deliverable.
                        - Refunds will be processed within **5 business days** and credited back to the original payment method.
